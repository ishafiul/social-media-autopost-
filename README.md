# social-media-autopost-
this is a script for Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter auto-post when a new post added to your website 

I made this for my own purpose. this is a basic function, not even organized well. maybe ill do it later 

for this code you need to install twitter OAuth (https://twitteroauth.com/ ) and Facebook SDK (https://github.com/facebookarchive/php-graph-sdk)


# define.php
here you will just put you app info for facebook and twitter. 

put you facebook page id at $pageId
put your instagram id at $instagramAccountId

(for instagram id you can use facebook Graph API Explorer tool. make a get call like this 'page_id?fields=instagram_business_account'. and dont forgot to convert your instagramn to business account. and also add your instagram to your page)

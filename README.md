# social-media-autopost-
this is a script for Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter auto-post when a new post added to your website 

I made this for my own purpose. this is a basic function, not even organized well. maybe ill do it later 

fo this code you need to install twitter OAuth (https://twitteroauth.com/ ) and Facebook SDK (https://github.com/facebookarchive/php-graph-sdk)
